# SpaceGame

## What is this?

SpaceGame is intended to be a very simple project that Unity that (as much as possible) adheres to the SOLID design principles, and whose development is Test Driven.

It is also a test bed for me to investigate which design patterns best facilitate this design approach, and if it's even really feasible to use these programming ideas in a Unity game.

## Rationale

I am primarily a web developer, and in that world, things like TDD, smart package management, and separation of logic and implementation are taken for granted. In the world of Unity development (and game development in general), these concepts are still there, but far less people see a point in using them.

This project aims to build a small, functional project that can serve as the basis for other SOLID Unity games.

## Currently usable?

The code should allow you to run a lot of tests, and there are two acceptance testing scenes which should allow you to move around a planet with a little space ship, but no real game logic implementation yet. This is expected to come bit by bit, and with lots of revisions along the way.

## Dependencies

I've decided to include all the dependencies that this project has with the exception of the Unity Test Tools, which should be downloaded from the asset store.

This will probably change once the project gets to a more usable state.
